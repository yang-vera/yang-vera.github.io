Clinical Notes
DILRAJ SINGH GREWAL, MD at 9/17/2020  9:00 AM
Status: Signed
29 y.o. F referred by Dr. Postel for evaluation of vitritis OS.
 
1.
Posterior uveitis, left eye 脉络膜视网膜炎
2.
Vitreomacular adhesion of left eye 玻璃体粘连
3.
Myelinated nerve fibers of optic disc of right eye 
右眼视盘的有髓神经纤维
 
 
Brief Prior History:
HPI as documented was explored in detail and no additional concerns reported.
 
Workup:
                        NEGATIVE: ACE, CBC, CMP, Syphilis Ab, Quantiferon,                  Beta2 microglubulin, UA
Course and  Prior Treatment
Onset 2019: Decreased sensitivity to light OS, unremarkable eval at Wake Ophthalmology at that time.  Recently seen by Dr. Medeiros who noted PVD OS. Mild persistent flashing lights and floaters
Current Drops:
None
Past Medical History:
                        Chronic Lymphocytic thyroiditis
                        Moved from China 2 yrs ago
Past Ocular History: 
PVD OS
Vitritis OS
Family History:
None known
Imaging
CXR - not done
 
Review of Systems:
Denies any recent weight loss/gain, fevers/chills, night sweats, fatigue, generalized weakness, easy bruising/bleeding, tremor or intolerance to heat or cold, sicca symptoms, nasal ulcers, oral ulcers, cold sores, genital ulcers, difficulty swallowing, chest pain, shortness of breath, wheezing, cough, blood in sputum, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, changes in bowel or bladder patterns, change in urine, weakness/numbness/tingling of limbs/digits, muscle pain, rash, hives, sun sensitivity, hair loss, headache, dizziness, seizure, tinnitus, hearing loss, depression, anxiety, enlarged lymph nodes. Denies h/o STDs, recent foreign travel or exposure to pets/animals
 
Posterior Uveitis with Retinal Vasculitis OS ?AIR 
- subj:              photopsias, floaters  闪光
- BCVA:           OD 20/25, OS 20/32
- Exam:            OD: tesselated fundus 豹纹状眼底：一种非病理性的正常眼底
                        OS: tesselated fundus, PVD
- OCT:             OD: compact
                        OS: EZ loss w/ sparing of central island, mild ERM
                       注： An epiretinal membrane (ERM) 黄斑前膜（症）is a fibrocellular tissue found on the inner surface of the retina. It is semi-translucent and proliferates on the surface of the internal limiting membrane.
- FAF:              OD: unremarkable
                        OS: central area of normal AF 注：Autofluorescence 自体荧光, large paracentral近中部的 area of hypoAF 超自发荧光 that extends into periphery周围
 
- FA:                OD: staining at nerve, no leak
                            OS: staining at nerve, capillary dropout throughout, diffuse perivenous leakage throughout
 
A/P: Retinal vasculitis视网膜脉管炎 OS w/ loss PR loss throughout the periphery.  Given negative w/u and strikingly asymmetric presentation, would obtain AIR//ON panel.  DDx also includes demyelinating disorders, so would also consider obtaining MRI brain CNII protocol w/wo and NMO Abs (also would be useful for IMT tx options if autoimmune etiology uncovered).  Will also obtain ffERG and pVEP. 
OD with myleinated NFL and there is VMA without VMT OU
 
 
Plan
Check ANCA, HLA B27 and UA

Check anti-retinal and anti-optic nerve ab for AIR
 
Schedule ffERG and pVEP OU and HVF 24-2
 
RV 8 weeks for exam/OCT mac + RNFL + Optos FAF OU
(same day with Lisa Carnago to discuss IMT) (after ffERG and pVEP done)

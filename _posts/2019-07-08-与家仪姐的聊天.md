# When you jump out from a fight, you show strength, not weakness.
* Everytime when I have a fight with Yang, the best choice is to calm down, and tell him let's stop this.
* I should say "I do not like you tone, even though you do not mean that, but this is really hurt."
* You have to know that I do love you, I do not want a fight with you. All I need is your understanding.
* Let's talk about this when we calm down.
# Stay patient in marriage. 
* Try to understand that all fights are temporary, they are the only way must be passed.
* When you starting to worry about him, please try to guide him, help him instead of letting yourself do it. That is his path.
* Give him a chance to be strong and confident. Give him a chance to face obstacles and difficuties. Do not try to do all the things for him.
* Make important decisions together.
* Talk about details more than concepts.
# Discovery and development.
* Be wise more than intelligent.

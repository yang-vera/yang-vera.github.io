> Yet another man.

Hi, I am Yang Zhao, a software developer. I am currently working in [SAS Institute Inc.](https://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html) and this is also my first full-time job. I studied operations research at North Carolina State University and graduated in May, 2018. Before that, I graduated from Huazhong University of Science and Technology with a bachelor degree in Financial Management in 2013.
